# fourier_series

## Files and Descriptions

- **projectile_motion.py**: This script simulates the projectile motion of an object under gravity.
- **sin_wave.py**: Python script for simulating an epicycle to generate a sinusoidal wave.

- **square_wave.py**: Python script to generate a square wave using the Fourier series. This script illustrates how a square wave can be constructed by adding sine waves of different frequencies and amplitudes, following the principle of Fourier series epicycles.

- related animations are uploaded for visualization purposes.
